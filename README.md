# Depression-Detection-using-twitter
Live tweets are stored in a database. The sentimental analysis is performed on the tweets.Here we can also see the tweets of a particular user as well as their sentiment and also the medium from which they have tweeted. If the number of negative sentiments detected is high then a form is opened which is linked with the AWS database and the data is then sent to the consultant. If the person is depressed then he/she can get help by just observing the sentiments of their tweets.
